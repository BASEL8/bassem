    title: 'Less Than 35',
    subtitle: 'Palau De la Musica',
    content: `As a recent graduate with a passion for both classical music and design, I was thrilled to be given the opportunity to work on a special project for Palau de la Música Catalana, a world-renowned concert venue located in the heart of Barcelona. The management of the Palau recognized the need to attract a younger audience and bridge the gap between classical music concerts and the under 35 crowd. This presented a unique challenge and an exciting opportunity for me to merge my two interests and create an event that would excite and engage young people in this timeless genre.<div class="hidden_text"> I knew that I had the skills and creativity to design an experience that would appeal to this demographic, while still honoring the traditions and beauty of classical music. I was eager to take on this challenge and develop a concept that would bring a new generation of music lovers to the Palau.
    <span class="headline">Development</span>
    As I began working on the project, I knew that it was important to follow the direct communication style outlined in the brief in order to effectively reach and engage our target audience of young people. This led me to the decision to name the festival <35, or Less than thirty-five, as a way of emphasising the event's focus on accessibility and inclusivity for those under 35 years of age. The festival was designed to be a monthly event, held at the Palau on the first Saturday of each month, with the goal of providing a new and unique way for young people to experience and enjoy classical music.
    The inspiration for the festival's design came from the movements of a conductor's hand, which I saw as reminiscent of one-line art when paired with a brush. This style, popularised by artists such as Pablo Picasso, captures the fast-paced and streamlined lifestyle of young people by simplifying complex and realistic subjects into a single continuous line. The freedom of movement and lack of focus on details represented by one-line art aligns with the fast-paced and straightforward nature of the target demographic.
    Choosing the color palette for <35 was a challenging task, as I wanted to find a balance between appealing to the target group and maintaining the classical image of the Palau. Ultimately, I chose to use the modern and classical combination of black and white, as concerts are not primarily a visual experience and musicians often wear these colors. I believed that this color palette would allow the event to appeal to both the classical music enthusiasts and the younger audience we were seeking to attract.
    <span class="headline">The Blindfolded concerts</span>
    One of the standout features of <35 was the concept of the Blindfolded concerts. This experience was designed to emphasise the importance of music by eliminating all distractions and allowing the audience to fully immerse themselves in the sound of the music.
    The idea for the Blindfolded concerts came from the realisation that, rather than adding more elements to a classical music concert, such as lighting or a minibar, it was more impactful to remove all distractions and allow the music to be the main focus. By doing so, we were able to create a unique and unparalleled experience that had never been done before at the Palau.
    During the Blindfolded concerts, the audience was invited to listen to classical music in a very dark hall, with dim lighting and the option to wear blindfolds for those who wanted to experience complete darkness during the concert. The main objective of this experience was to direct the audience's attention to the sound of the music alone, eliminating all visual distractions. It was an innovative way to highlight the beauty and power of classical music and provide a truly immersive listening experience.
    <span class="headline">Campaign</span>
    The advertising campaign for <35 was designed to utilise the direct communication style and convey the message that Palau de la Música Catalana loves and values young people. This message was intended to be conveyed through the use of three different languages: English, the universal language of love; a heart drawing, a symbol of affection; and the Catalan word "joves," meaning young people. The campaign slogan, "We Love Joves," was meant to show the audience that the Palau truly cared about and wanted to engage with them.
    To reach the target audience, the campaign utilised various methods of advertising, including youth magazines and roadside ads. However, the main focus was on going to unexpected places where young people congregate, such as nightclubs, and relying on the element of surprise to capture their attention. At these venues, attendees would see a message appear on screens during moments of joy, happiness, and high emotion, inviting them to attend <35. In addition to these more traditional forms of advertising, we also utilised personal interactions with young people, such as distributing flyers and word of mouth, to spread the word about the festival. Overall, the campaign was designed to be inclusive, engaging, and reflective of the Palau's commitment to young people and classical music.</div>`,

    content: `"Uncovering the Cultural Significance and Mystical Aspects of Waaca, a Modern Coffee Shop and Art Shop"
    As a modern coffee shop and art shop, Waaca has gained a reputation for its unique mono color scheme of coffee hues and its commitment to contemporary design. But did you know that Waaca also offers the opportunity to delve into the mystical aspects of coffee, including fortune-telling and unconscious drawing?
    <div class="hidden_text">
    The name "Waaca" itself holds cultural significance rooted in the mythology of the Oromo people, the native nation of Ethiopia where coffee was first discovered. According to Oromo beliefs, the single God, Waaqa, created the world and has a special connection to coffee. Two myths about coffee's origins are prominent among the Oromos. The first legend states that coffee was one of the first things brought down from heaven to earth, while the second tells the story of Waaqa shedding tears over the grave of a loved one, which then caused coffee plants to emerge from the ground.
    The name "Waaca" is derived from the first letters of "caffeine" and "Waaqa," honoring this cultural history. As a modern coffee shop and art shop, Waaca serves as a tribute to the enduring influence of the Oromo people and their connection to coffee.
    But Waaca is more than just a place to enjoy a delicious cup of coffee and browse contemporary art. It's also a place to discover the mystical aspects of coffee, including the ancient practice of fortune-telling through coffee grounds. At Waaca, visitors can have their coffee cup read by a skilled fortune-teller, gaining insight into their future and unlocking the secrets of the universe.
    In addition to fortune-telling, Waaca also offers the opportunity to participate in unconscious drawing sessions, using coffee as a medium for artistic expression. During these sessions, participants are guided to let go of their conscious thoughts and allow their hands to move freely, creating unique works of art using the aromatic and grounding qualities of coffee.
    By exploring the cultural significance and mystical aspects of Waaca, we can gain a deeper appreciation for the shop's unique name and the rich mythology that inspired it, as well as the artistic and divinatory potential of coffee.
    <span class="headline">Hidden Text and illustrations, You have to spill coffee to be able to see them.</span>

It transforms a seemingly mundane and unremarkable piece of art into a dynamic and interactive experience that engages the senses and challenges the viewer's perceptions.
    So, if you want to see the hidden text and illustrations in this particular piece of art, you will have to take the bold and risky step of spilling coffee on it.

    Transparency is an essential component of any relationship, and this is especially true in the relationship between students and their university. By exhibiting transparency, universities can build trust, foster positive relationships, and facilitate increased participation and productivity. The exhibition of 100 photographic self-portraits of IED Visual students serves as a powerful example of transparency in action, showcasing the unique characteristics and personal perspectives of each student while providing insight into their thoughts on the school. <div class="hidden_text"> By exhibiting these self-portraits in a transparent manner, the university demonstrates its commitment to fostering a positive and inclusive environment for all students. If you agree with a student's perspective and wish to show your support, you can participate in this transparent display that helps build trust, relationships, and boost productivity and innovation. Overall, the transparency displayed in this exhibition serves as a reminder of the importance of honesty and openness in building strong relationships and fostering a sense of community within the university. By promoting transparency and working to address discrimination, universities can create a more supportive and inclusive environment for all students and facilitate their success and well-being.
    The relationship between students and their university is a multifaceted one that is essential to the success and well-being of both parties. Universities play a vital role in the educational and personal development of their students, providing a space for learning, growth, and the formation of meaningful connections. A positive relationship between students and their university can create a supportive and engaging environment that promotes academic achievement and personal growth.
    In addition to providing a supportive environment for learning and personal development, universities also serve as a resource for students as they navigate their academic and professional careers. Many universities offer a variety of services and support to help students succeed, such as academic advising, career counselling, and tutoring. By building a strong relationship with the university, students can access these resources more effectively and take full advantage of the opportunities available to them.
    Universities are also often connected to the larger community through strong relationships with local businesses, organisations, and other institutions. These connections provide students with the opportunity to explore potential career paths and involvement opportunities within the broader community. A positive relationship with the university can help students tap into these networks and make the most of their time on campus.
    Transparency is a key factor in maintaining trust and fostering a positive relationship between students and their university. This requires the university to be open and honest in its communications with students and to clearly disclose information about policies, procedures, and decision-making processes. For example, if the university is considering making changes to its curriculum or tuition fees, it should clearly communicate the reasons for these changes to students and seek input from them before finalising any decisions. Similarly, if the university is facing challenges or controversies, it should be transparent in addressing these issues and involve students in finding solutions.
    Transparency can also involve making information readily available to students, such as posting policies and procedures on the university's website or facilitating access to academic records and other important documents. By being transparent and open in its dealings with students, the university can build trust and foster a more positive relationship with its student body.
    Unfortunately, discrimination among students on the basis of race and class is still an issue at many universities. This can have a number of negative consequences, including creating a hostile and unwelcoming environment for those targeted, limiting access to opportunities and resources, perpetuating existing inequalities and power imbalances, and damaging the reputation of the university. It is important for universities to actively work to prevent and address discrimination in order to create an inclusive and supportive environment for all students</div>.
